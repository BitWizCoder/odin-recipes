    <h1>Grandma's Chocolate Cake</h1>

    <img src="../images/cake.webp" alt="cake image">

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This is hands-down my all-time favorite cake! I fell in love making it after my grandmother shared the recipe with me. This cake is super quick, easy, and fun to make! Definitely recommend this for first time bakers and anyone else who would love to take a bite out of a delicious chocolate Texas sheet cake.
